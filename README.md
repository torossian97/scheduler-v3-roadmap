## TL;DR

A single-page roadmap that served as a single source of truth for what would be shipped, and when. For external and internal stakeholders, with interactive options.

Saved hours of comms via emails, messages etc.

## The Problem

Being the Product Manager for Scheduler, and with Nylas annoucing EOL for Scheduler v2, there were a lot of questions and apprehension around when Scheduler v3 would be ready.

Scheduler v3 was a 2-quarter initiative, and we wanted to make sure we shipped incrementally to beta to avoid waterfalling everything in the general release.

With all of this in mind, there was A LOT of noise hitting me from customers, customer success, sales, and leadership.

"When will X feature be shipped?", "What will be different in v3?", etc.

Jira roadmaps weren't publicly available for customers, and proved far too overwhelming for internal teams that already had 101 things to keep track of.

## The Solution

A single-page roadmap, hosted on it's own public domain, that served as a single source of truth for what would be shipped, and when.

Customers could select the features they were using in v2, and see when the projected date was when their particular use-case would have parity with v3.

This was updated every time we shipped, and became used relogiously by every stakeholder.

## The Outcome

Hours of time a week was saved communicating what would be shipped, when. There were hundreds of CSMs, sales people, leaders and customers who all needed to know these answers.

The noise went from 100 to 0 overnight once this was launched.
